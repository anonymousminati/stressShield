        "Yoga offers numerous mental health benefits, including reduced anxiety and depression, improved cognitive skills, and enhanced mood. Regular yoga practice strengthens parts of the brain associated with memory, attention, awareness, and language. It also helps counteract age-related declines in cognitive function. Yoga can elevate levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a brain chemical linked to better mood and reduced anxiety. Additionally, meditation, a key component of yoga, reduces emotional reactivity and improves mood. Studies suggest that yoga is effective in alleviating depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).",
